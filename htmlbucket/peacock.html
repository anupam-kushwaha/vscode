    <b>Peafowl</b> is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo
    and Afropavo of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl
    are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are
    referred to as peahens, even though peafowl of either sex are often referred to
    colloquially as "peacocks".

    <p>
        The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent,
        and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the Congo peafowl,
        native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their
        extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species,
        which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they
        display as part of a courtship ritual.
